    <h1>I’m Dumber Than I Look <small>I'll let you be the judge</small></h1>
    <i>Wednesday, April 13, 2016  </i>
    <p>
        This whole tumblr thing… it’s complicated when you’re first getting started.  I’m hoping that I am successfully blogging this.  But, I have my doubts.

        I wasn’t prepared for the dashboard (which really tells you nothing) being such a social frenzy. Not exactly sure what my page looks like because the dashboard shows a different theme than my actual theme. Is there something I’m missing?  I’m sure day two will go much better. As a web developer, I would think I was much smarter than this.

    <h1>The Birth of A Website <small>not this one, that other one</small></h1>
    <i>November 11th, 2011</i>
    <p>Today is the birth of the Bakle House website. I have thought for years about attempting such a feat. Much like an actual birth, there has been lots of grunting and complaining. But, with inspiration, determination, and many other 'ations', it has finally arrived. I thought it was time to start flexing my bits and bytes and assemble them into a goolosh of binary numbers to be served into stimulating images and code mastery for the worlds enjoyment. But mostly I did it to fuel my own ego and attempt to put out an online resume of what I am capable of. For now, just look and don't touch. Expensive coding at work.</p>

                It's a bit rendundant, yes. However, I was told to self promote. Having mostly taught myself web design
                as well as not having a career in web development,
                there isn't a lot of opportunity to create or be involved in projects. So, I added this to the list. It fills up space.
                It is really all part of my plan to set you into an infinate loop of nothing but me.

                What do ya think of the picture? I was going for pensive. Don't think so? Me neither.
