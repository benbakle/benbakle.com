        <h1>First, a little about me <small>let me clear my throat...</small></h1>
        <p>
            I am a self-taught web developer. When in college, I began as a
            computer science major.  After my freshman year, I was worried I would end up hacking code in some dark corner hating my life, so I changed my major. 
            Who knew later on my mind would run rampant with problem solving code and design ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, I was able to retain the logic I learned from the classes I did take. In my mid to late 20's I reentered the world of
            programming through web design.  I have always loved the idea of creating something interactive and dynamic.
            I started with simple pages using <code>HTML</code>. Later, with some guidance from my now 
            <a href="http://jon.fazzaro.com/" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jon Fazzaro" target="_blank">mentor</a> 
            and the help of the internet, I willed
            myself into understanding how to create interactive pages with <code>VBScript</code> using a Microsoft Access&trade; database.
            I used these skills to create a web page for Conser Music (Fort Wayne, IN) allowing the owner access through a login to change pricing, update product,
            leave messages, take payments, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after the creation of consermusic.com, I was introduced to ASP.NET Web Forms. Using Web Forms,
            my brother-in-law, <a href="http://jon.fazzaro.com">Jon Fazzaro</a>, and I started a business, Bzaro Web Design and Applications, where we created an interactive web site
            allowing for an admin to log in, add/sort pages based on a topic, submit requests from the web page, and other user functionality. I mostly worked on the design,
            however it was a great introduction to Web Forms.  Bzaro unfortunately didn't stand the test of time lasting about a year.
        </p>
        <p>
            I later took the excitment of ASP.NET Web Forms solo and created my largest project to date, <a href="#" class="scroll-click" id="scroll-st">www.sensortecinc.com</a>.
            During this project, even I was surprised by the number of learning experiences had.  Acquiring knowledge of such things as <code>VB.NET</code>, <code>JavaScript/jQuery</code>,
            <code>JSON</code> data arrays, <code>CSS</code>, AJAX requests, creating different levels of authorization,
            modal pop-ups, and on and on. This application was created with sheer determination and a strong desire to learn new concepts.
            (honorable mention to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and the kind people of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
            After this experience I thought that my knowledge had grown considerably until I learned about ASP.NET MVC.
            It is light weight and follows a simple logic. It seemed to be the next logical step in web design, so I had to up
            my game.  I started by creating several practice projects until I was prepared to launch
            <a href="#" class="scroll-click" id="scroll-jyb">www.joelyoungband.com</a>.  Using MVC and Code First Migration, I was
            able to create a band website giving users a <i>CRUD</i> (create / read / update / delete) interface to add Venues, Shows, etc.
            In implementing this project, I was introduced to such tools as <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">bootstrap</a> and many other plugins.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's been a long journey, so having acquired all this knowledge, I thought it was time to start flexing my bits and bytes and assemble them into a goulash of binary numbers to
            be served into stimulating images and code mastery for the worlds enjoyment... or as an attempt to put out an
            online portfolio demonstrating what I am capable of. Walk, don't run. Expensive coding at work.

            It's a bit redundant. But, I use my site as my sandbox for learning new techniques and sharing my
            experiences with those who will listen. Having mostly taught myself web design,
            as well as not having a career in web development,
            there isn't a lot of opportunity to create or be involved in projects. It fills up space.
            In actuality, it is part of my plan to set you into an infinite loop of nothing but me.
            What do ya think of the picture? I was going for pensive. Don't think so? Me neither.
